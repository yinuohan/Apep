This set of programs were used to generate the geometric model for Apep. 

The code I usually run is something like Run_spiral.m, which calls spiral.m, the main function that does the computation. 

A few other helper functions are also provided. Some of these help convert between the true anomaly, eccentric anomaly and time offset.
