# Apep

### Update: new science results in paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05834).

Welcome! Here are a few pieces of sample code I used to look at Apep the spiral as part of my honours project. 

Some programs referenced in the thesis include:

#### Chapter 3
- VISIR calibration: /VISIR/VISIR_CALIBRATION.py
- ridge-crawler: /VISIR/ridge-crawler.py

#### Chapter 4
- NACO calibration: /NACO/WINDOW_CUBES.py

#### Chapter 5
- MIR aperture photometry: /photometry/VISIR_photometry.py
- NIR aperture photometry: /photometry/NACO_photometry_2019.py
- Calibration against PSF: /photometry/Flux_PSF.py
- Interstellar dereddening: /photometry/unred.py

#### Chapter 6
- Geometric model: /model/spiral.m
- MCMC: /model/MCMC.m
